Cryptocurrency as a revolutionary fund
=====================================

What is the Crypto World Trust?
----------------

The Crypto World Trust is a digital currency fund addressing the
financial needs of minor & independent nation-states while inherently
maintaining their sovereignty by circumventing dependence upon
traditional means of national developement through alignment with
major Blocs or Superpowers, and entities such as the I.M.F.


Participant nations would receive a set grant allocated by the Trust 
from funds generated in CWT Coin investment. The debt would then be covered
by the continued growth of investment. Participant Nations would in turn 
be required to endorse cryptocurrency market trade and, (because they 
would not receive more funds until the costs to CWT from their previous 
grant is covered) incentivized to invite a greater pool of investors to 
the Trust from their native population.


The Crypto World Trust is to be fueled by the endorsement of participants
from independent investors, to national Governments participating in &
benefitting from the C.W.T. fund, and Cryptocurrency at large would sooner
gain rapid legitimacy amongst the many nations of the world. 
Truly, a global revolution.
